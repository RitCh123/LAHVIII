## Purpose

Forms can often be "boring". When someone asks you to fill out a survey or questionnaire, usually the standard questions appear without delving deeper into the questions (e.g. How can we improve our products, what enables us to connect with other, etc.)
Our goal is to create an application that, based on user feedback, can accurately identity the user's concerns, elaborate on these concerns, and optimize the user's time while they are filling out the survey. The survey can be customizable and in different UI designs, leading to more engagement from the user.
